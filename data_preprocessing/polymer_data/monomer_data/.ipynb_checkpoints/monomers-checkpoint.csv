Cationic,(3-acrylamidopropyl)trimethylammonium chloride,Tma,C[N+](C)(C)CCCNC(=O)C=C,10,90,10,90,5,206.71,"FOR ALL MONOMERS: the C=C double bond goes away during polymerization, as a new CC bond forms between monomers. Might need to remove the C=C from these SMILES representations"
Cationic,guanidinoethyl acrylamide ,Aeg,[Cl-].NC(=[NH2+])NCCNC(=O)C=C,10,90,0,20,5,192.65,"Haven't used this yet, but I could try it moving forward. It is more synthetically challenging."

Endgroup (back),,Z,O=C(O)CCSC=S,,,,,,,connects via the carbon bonded to the =S (bold)
Endgroup (front),,R,CC(C#N)CCC(=O)O,,,,,,,More common front end. Connects via the bold C
,,AIBN,CC(C)C#N,,,,,,,Less common front end. Connects via the bold C
